Brick Breaker Game 
=========================

Done as part of an assignment given to me at TechPrimeLabs Ltd while working as a Software Developer Intern.

Implemented the brick breaker game by modeling basic collision behaviour between a ball, a set of bricks and the surrounding wall. Keyboard based interaction was implemented for all of the levels.

Developed using HTML5 Canvas and TypeScript.

With this seed, you should be able to:

1. Develop in JavaScript
2. Test in JavaScript
3. Build and bundle to JavaScript

**Note:** Ported 

Clone this git repo. Open 'gameFin.html' in a browser.

2.  Personalize the following files for your project:
    - `LICENSE`
    - `package.json`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`
    - `README.md`

    See [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html) for more on customizing `package.json`.

## webpack

Customize `webpack.config.js` as necessary. Configuration are pretty much like command-line args to webpack.


Preset:

* `entry` - file to start bundling from
* `output.filename` - name of the unoptimized compiled file
* `output.library` - name of exported library (e.g. `MyAwesomeProject()`)
* `output.libraryTarget` - exporting library to global scope. In this case, preset to [`umd`](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/umd) (Universal Module Definition), which enables library to be exported to browser, CommonJS,


Build
=====

1.  Run `gulp prod` to build the distributable.

    This places a minified js file in `./dist/` folder.

    The associated distributable source map file(s) is/are generated. -->
